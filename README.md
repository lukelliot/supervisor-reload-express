# Supervisor-Reload-Express

Boilerplate for html/css/js

- `supervisor` for file watching
- `reload` for browser refresh
- `express` for local server

The `/` endpoint will be routed to the index.html file by default.

## Development Server

The development server can be started with `npm run start` on `http://localhost:3000`.

Use the `process.env.PORT` environment variable to configure a different port.
